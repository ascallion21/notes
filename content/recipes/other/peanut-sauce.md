# Peanut Sauce

Recipe from [Fox and Briar](https://foxandbriar.com)

A few notes about this recipe:

- You can make this spicy peanut sauce by using more chili garlic sauce.  You can sub sriracha if you have it on hand, but I prefer the flavor of chili garlic sauce.
- You can use honey instead of brown sugar, however I find that the flavor of the peanut sauce is better with brown sugar.
- Use more water to thin the sauce and use as a peanut sauce dressing for salad.
- What can you dip in this peanut sauce? Spring rolls, lettuce wraps, veggies, chicken, coconut shrimp, tofu.  You can use this peanut dipping sauce for just about anything!

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup peanut butter natural, unsweetened
- 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce use tamari or coconut aminos for gluten free
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce more or less to taste
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 3 garlic cloves pressed or grated
- 1 tablespoon ginger root grated
- 2-4 tablespoons warm water

## Instructions

Combine all ingredients except water.  Whisk to fully combine.
Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached. I normally use 2 tablespoons for a sauce and up to four if using it for a dressing. 

## Notes

I use unsweetened peanut butter.  If you use conventional peanut butter the sauce may turn out too sweet.  Try reducing the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon.
