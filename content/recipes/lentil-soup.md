# Lentil Soup

Recipe from Carol

## Ingredients

- 1 bag of lentils
- 4 red potatoes
- 1 summer sausage
- 1 red onion
- 1 bouilion cube
- 1 garlic clove
- salt
- pepper

## Directions

Pour the lentils into a big pot and add water within an inch of the top of the pot. Drop in the bouilion cube. Peal the garlic clove and cut it into small pieces, then add it to the pot. Shake in salt and pepper according to taste. Cover the pot and heat it up to boiling. When the pot boils, turn down the heat a little so it doesn't boil over and let cook. While waiting for the pot to cook, wash the potatoes and cut them up into small cubes, then add them to the pot. Cook until the lentils and potatoes are done.

While the pot is still cooking at a low boil, take the skin off the sausage and slice it up and then cut each slice into nine cubes by cutting it twice in each direction. Then stir the sausage into the pot and heat it. Cut the onion into quarters and then slice so that the pieces are about an inch long. Stir the onions into the pot and let cook until the onion is cooked enough.
