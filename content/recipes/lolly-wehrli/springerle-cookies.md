# Springerle Cookies

Recipe from Lolly Wehrli

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. of confectioner's sugar
- 4 eggs
- 4 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tbs. melted butter
- anise about 4 drops
- anise seeds

## Directions

Beat four eggs until fluffy and then add one pound of confectioner's sugar gradually. Beat until consistency is thick and custardy (about forty-five minutes with a mix-master). Sift the four cups of flour with one teaspoon of baking ~~soda~~ powder and gradually add to egg/sugar mixture. Add melted butter and anise (which is licorice flavored) to tast, about four drops. Work dough until manageable and press onto flour dusted boards. Take dough off of boards and cut the cookies apart. Sprinkle a cookie sheet with anise seeds, place cookies on it and let fry overnight. If in the morning the edges appear drier than the middle wet finger tip with water and trace along the edges of each cookie. This is so they will rise evenly. Bake in a slow oven (300-325 degrees) about twenty minutes.

Yields about four dozen cookies.

Cookies may last up to two months. To keep from hardening place in a jar or container with a damp cloth or piece of bread.
