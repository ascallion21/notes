# Chapter 2

Observations -> Theory -> Hypothesis

## Exam Questions

### What is a law vs theory?

Principles that are so general as to apply to all situations in a given domain of inquiry are known as laws.

A theory is an integrated set of principles that explains and predicts many, but not all, observed relationships within a given domain of inquiry.

## IRB = Institutional Review Board

A group of regular people and scientists that make sure an experiement is ethical.

## Research Designs

Common-causal variables may cause both the predictor and outcome variable in a correlational design, producing a spurious relationship. The possibility of common-causal variables makes it impossible to draw causal conclusions from correlational research designs.

### Descriptive

Describe current state of things.

The goal of these designs is to get a picture of the current thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in a given group of people.

### Correlational

Observe relationship between 2 or more variables.

Cannot be used to draw inferences about the causal relationships between and among the variables.

### Experimental

Independent -> dependent variable experiments.

Needs a control group.
