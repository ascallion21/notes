# A Workout a Day

A Workout a Day is a workout routine newsletter aimed at making it easy and simple to work out.

## App

[Download the app](https://github.com/gscanlon21/a-workout-a-day/releases). App tokens are generated from the preferences page on the [website](https://aworkoutaday.com). 

The program [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) can be used for automatic updates. 

## Features

- Customizable workout splits, intensity, and rest days.
- Workouts are simplified for users who are new to fitness to build consistency and reduce injury risk.
- Exercises are chosen from equipment you have access to — no pullups without a pullup bar or fitness rings.
- Ignore unwanted exercises — no more burpees!
- Progress or regress exercises to switch between easier and harder variations.
- Track how much weight you are able to lift.
- Customize how long you want to see exercises before they refresh.
- Customize how much each muscle is being strengthened. Workouts are automatically adjusted to remove muscle imbalances.
- Customize how often you want to deload. Built-in deload weeks automatically adjust your workout to prevent overtraining.
- Optional health and fitness tips.
- Optional mobility workouts on rest days.
- Optional sports, injury prevention, and rehabilitation exercises.

## Why a Newsletter?

Other fitness apps require users to keep track of how often they need to workout and seek the workouts themselves. I find that reminder notifications are too easy to swipe away or disable when they arrive at inconvenient times. Opening a dedicated fitness app can also be intimidating or overwhelming. A Workout a Day sends at most one workout per day and utilizes your email client's features to remind you later, or pin the workout, so that it's always visible when you check your email.

However, emails have their limitations as well. A Workout a Day is geared towards new-to-fitness users or users who aren't as inclined to optimize their workout to 100%.
